## Features

### Navigation and Layout

- **Three-column Miller columns** interface (parent / current / preview)
- **Owner-based navigation**: Clusters -> Resource Types -> Resources -> Owned Resources -> Containers
- **Resource groups**: Dashboards, Workloads, Networking, Config, Storage, ArgoCD, Helm, Access Control, Cluster, Custom Resources
- **Pinned resource types**: Pin individual resource types (built-in or CRD) into a "Pinned" section at the top of the list, below the dashboards. Configurable via `pinned_types` in config (legacy `pinned_groups` also supported) or interactively with `p` key (stored per-context or per named union set)
- **Pinned dashboard summaries**: Pin any resource type's status summary (Jobs failed/succeeded, Argo app health/sync, any CRD's phase/conditions rollup) as inline rows on the cluster dashboard for a one-page daily health check. Shows Jobs, Deployments, Argo CD Applications, Flux Kustomizations, and cert-manager Certificates by default (CRD-backed defaults appear only when installed); your first pin keeps the defaults you see and adds your type. Toggle from the action menu (`x`) at the resource types level, or set `pinned_summaries` in config (max 10 per scope; stored per-context or per named union set)
- **CRD categories**: Discovered CRDs are grouped by API group name (e.g., `argoproj.io`, `longhorn.io`, `networking.istio.io`)
- **Hide rarely used resources**: CSI internals, admission webhooks, APF, leases, runtime classes, and uncategorized core resources are hidden by default. Press `H` to surface them (dimmed) under their categories and an "Advanced" group (resets each launch; set `show_rare_types: true` in config to show them from startup)
- **Hide individual resource types**: At the resource types level, open the action menu (`x`) on a type to hide or show it. Hidden types are saved per cluster context (or named union set) and stay hidden across restarts. Press `H` to reveal hidden types dimmed so you can un-hide them
- **Expandable/collapsible resource groups** with `z`
- **Layout cycle** with `Shift+F` — hide sidebar, then fullscreen middle column, then restore
- **Vim-style keybindings** throughout (fully customizable via config)
- **Mouse support**: Click to navigate, scroll wheel scrolls the pane under the pointer, `Ctrl+Option+Y` toggles mouse capture, Shift+Drag for native terminal text selection

### Cluster Management

- **Multi-tab support**: Open multiple views side by side
- **Multi-cluster/multi-context support** via merged kubeconfig loading
- **Merged kubeconfig loading**: `~/.kube/config`, `~/.kube/config.d/*` (recursive, symlinks followed), and `KUBECONFIG_DIR` env var. The `KUBECONFIG` env var is exclusive like kubectl — when set it replaces `~/.kube/config` and the default `config.d/` scan (explicit `--kubeconfig-dir`/`KUBECONFIG_DIR` still merge); opt out with `kubeconfig_exclusive: false`.
- **Union view**: Merge resources from multiple clusters into a single table with a `Context` column identifying the source, via `--union-context` (repeatable) or a named `--union-set` from config. See [Union View](docs/union-context.md).
- **Cluster dashboard** when entering a context (configurable)
- **Monitoring dashboard** with active Prometheus/Alertmanager alerts (`@` key), configurable endpoints per cluster
- **API Explorer** for interactively browsing resource structure (`I` key) with recursive field browser and an ASCII-art tree view (`T`, sticky across navigation; `Space` folds branches)
- **Object Explorer** for drilling into the selected resource's live object (`O` key); arrays expand into indexed elements, so recursive status trees (e.g. `.status.steps[].steps[]`) are walkable; live-refreshes under watch mode (`w` to pause, `R` to refresh manually); `T` toggles a tree view that expands the whole subtree with ASCII-art guides, `Space` folds branches
- **Schema side pane** (`Ctrl+K`) shows the cluster's own description of the field under the cursor, in a bordered pane beside the YAML viewer and Object Explorer; it follows the cursor, reads the connected cluster so CRDs resolve like built-in kinds, and caches what it reads
- **Namespace selector** overlay with type-to-filter
- **All-namespaces mode** (enabled by default)
- **Local cluster management** — create, list, and delete `kind` clusters; create, list, start, stop, and delete `k3d` and `minikube` clusters (kind has no native start/stop) from inside lfk via the `Ctrl+N` manager overlay.

### Resource Operations

- **Read-only mode**: Lock a session against destructive actions (delete, edit, scale, restart, exec, port-forward, drain, etc.). Enable with `--read-only`, the `read_only: true` config field, per-context `clusters.<name>.read_only`, or the in-app `Ctrl+R` toggle (toggles the highlighted row's `[RO]` marker at the cluster picker; toggles the current tab inside a context). A `[RO]` badge in the title bar marks active sessions. See [Read-Only Mode](docs/usage.md#read-only-mode).
- **Security dashboard**: Aggregated findings from Trivy, Kyverno, Kubescape, Falco, Gatekeeper, plus two built-in zero-dependency scanners: a heuristic Pod-spec scanner and an Advisor source with reliability recommendations (missing PDBs, quotas, probes, requests — dashboard-only, never on the SEC badge). Auto-detects installed sources, shows a per-resource SEC badge, and probes lazily on first use. Enable/disable globally or per cluster via `security.enabled` / `clusters.<name>.security`. See [Security Dashboard](docs/security.md).
- **Context-aware action menus**: logs, exec, attach, debug, scale, restart, delete, describe, edit, events, port-forward, vuln scan, PVC resize
- **Selectable delete cascade**: Both delete confirmations show the propagation policy and cycle it with `Tab` — `Background` (delete now, garbage collector removes dependents), `Foreground` (keep the object until dependents are gone), `Orphan` (leave dependents running), and `None` (send no policy, letting the API server decide; regular delete only, since force delete runs through `kubectl`). Applies to bulk delete too. The default is `Background`, sent explicitly, so deleting a Job no longer falls through to the API server's legacy `Orphan` default and leaves its pods running; picking `None` opts back into that server-side default deliberately. Change the default with `delete_propagation_policy`. See [Delete confirm dialog](docs/keybindings.md#delete-confirm-dialog).
- **Blast radius in destructive confirms**: The delete and drain dialogs state what the action costs before you answer — pods removed, ready replicas left, and the PodDisruptionBudget headroom spent. A budget the action would breach is marked in the warning color, so a drain that would hang on a blocking PDB is visible in the dialog rather than after the fact. See [Delete confirm dialog](docs/keybindings.md#delete-confirm-dialog).
- **Custom user-defined actions**: Define custom shell commands per resource type in config
- **Multi-select with bulk actions**: Select multiple resources with Space, range-select with Ctrl+Space, perform bulk delete, scale, restart, and ArgoCD bulk sync/refresh
- **Resource sorting** by name, age, or status, remembered per resource kind for the session
- **Filter and search**: Filter with `f`, search with `/` -- supports substring, regex (auto-detected), and fuzzy (`~` prefix) modes
- **Abbreviated search**: Type `pvc`, `hpa`, `deploy` etc. to jump to resource types
- **Command bar** (`:`) with vertical dropdown autocomplete: resource jumps (`:pod`, `:dep`), built-in commands (`:ns`, `:ctx`, `:set`, `:sort`, `:export`), kubectl with `:k`/`:kubectl` prefix and flag/namespace completion, shell commands (`:!`). Value positions (namespace, context, resource name, option, column, format) accept fuzzy matches; command names stay on prefix.
- **Watch mode**: Auto-refresh resources every 2 seconds (enabled by default)
- **Owner/controller navigation**: Jump to the owner of any resource with `o`
- **Events view** with warnings-only filter toggle and duplicate-event grouping (`z`)
- **Crash Investigator** — per-Pod tabbed view combining restart history, pod-scoped events, previous/current container logs, and container-scoped `describe` — accessible from the Pod action menu (`x` → `I`). Refresh with `Shift+R`.
- **Traffic capture** — per-pod packet capture (kubectl-debug or kubeshark, auto-detected) with live decode and pcap export. Press `c` on a Pod or Service.

### Preview and Editing

- **YAML preview** in the right column with syntax highlighting
- **Full-screen YAML viewer** with scrollable output, search, section folding (`Tab`/`z`), and in-place editing
- **Field-manager blame** (`m`) in the YAML viewer: who and when last wrote the line under the cursor, from `.metadata.managedFields`
- **Your name on your own writes**: lfk stamps the field manager `lfk:<os-user>`, so blame shows the person and not just the tool. Override or shorten it to plain `lfk` with the `field_manager` config field
- **Resource details** summary in split preview (toggle with `Shift+P`)
- **List status summary** band pinned at the bottom of the children pane (like the resource-usage footer) when hovering a resource type in the resource-type list — always shows the resource count, plus a colored status rollup for kinds with a health signal (ArgoCD Application health/sync, Pod phase, workload ready ratios, Node readiness, Namespace/PV/PVC phase, Flux & cert-manager Ready) — plus a generic `.status.phase` or `.status.conditions` rollup for any other kind that surfaces one — so you can confirm a whole list is healthy without drilling in
- **Inline log viewer** with streaming, search, live text filter (`f`: plain/`~`fuzzy/regex/`\`literal), severity filter (`i`/`o`: step the minimum level shown — INFO+/WARN+/ERROR+), line numbers, word wrap, follow mode (`F`), timestamps toggle, previous container logs, container filter, tail-first loading, line jump, structured preview pane (`P`: parses the selected line as JSON or logfmt, falls back to plain text), and automatic reconnect across init-container transitions (stays attached as each init container finishes and the next one starts)
- **Log Top** — aggregate a resource's logs by parsed attributes (method, host, path, status, service, or JSON/logfmt keys) showing request counts, REQ/s, ERR%, 4xx/5xx counts, avg/max latency, and p50/p95/p99 percentiles (when duration data is present). Columns auto-fit the terminal width (wider = more columns, up to all of REQ, REQ/s, ERR%, P50/P95/P99, ERR, 4XX, 5XX, AVG, MAX, %); `,` toggles/reorders columns. Auto-detects Traefik JSON, ingress-nginx, Envoy, NCSA common/combined access logs (nginx, Apache, Traefik default), JSON, and logfmt. Launch from the resource action menu ("Log Top") or press `T` in the open log viewer. In view: `g` group by, `p` profile, `,` columns (show/hide and reorder), `enter` drill down, sort key to re-sort, `esc` back.
- **Inline describe view** with scrollable output
- **Secret viewing/editing** with decode toggle (`Ctrl+S`) and dedicated editor (`e`)
- **Embedded terminal** (PTY mode) for exec and shell with tab switching — PTY keeps running in background when switching tabs

### Resource Management

- **Resource templates**: Create resources from 25+ built-in templates (`a`, `/` to search); includes a Custom Resource template as a starting point
- **Port forwarding** from the action menu (with local port setting and browser open); manage active forwards via the Networking group
- **Network policy visualizer**: Visualize a NetworkPolicy's ingress/egress rules (`x` → `N` on a NetworkPolicy), or list every policy affecting a Pod or Service (`x` → "Network Policies" on the resource) — including which backing pods a policy covers. Supports CiliumNetworkPolicy and CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy (entities, FQDNs, deny rules, L7 indicators) when the Cilium CRDs are installed. The dialog scrolls with the mouse wheel and is searchable (`/`, `n`/`N`)
- **Clipboard support**: Copy resource name (`y`), open copy-as picker (`Y`: YAML / JSON / Table), copy a single field via a filterable picker (`Ctrl+Y`: visible columns by default, `Tab` for all manifest fields — e.g. a node's external IP), paste/apply from clipboard (`Ctrl+P`), paste into search/filter boxes (`Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`)
- **Bookmarks**: Save favorite resource paths (including the active list filter) for quick navigation
- **Orphan detection**: Press `Shift+Z` (or run bare `:orphans`) to open the cluster-wide orphan overview across 11 kinds — Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services, PVCs, HPAs, PDBs, NetworkPolicies, Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings. Per-list filters are still available via the filter-preset overlay (`.`) on each kind, or jump straight to a filtered view with `:orphans <kind>` (e.g., `:orphans secrets`). A strict / lenient toggle (`s`) flips between "truly unused" and "currently idle but referenced by workload templates" (e.g. CronJob between firings). Auto-excludes Helm release Secrets, ServiceAccount tokens, owner-managed resources, and `kube-root-ca.crt`.
- **Session persistence**: Remembers last context/namespace/resource, the active list filter, and the highlighted row across restarts. **Named sessions** save the whole multi-tab workspace under a name and switch between them from the session manager (`C` or `:sessions`); the active session is auto-saved on quit and reopened on start, so working in one never clobbers another. Start on a specific one with `lfk --session <name>` (or `LFK_SESSION`)

### Integrations

- **ArgoCD integration**: Browse Applications, sync, terminate sync, refresh, view managed resources
- **Argo Workflows integration**: Suspend/resume, stop/terminate, resubmit Workflows; submit from WorkflowTemplates; suspend/resume CronWorkflows
- **Helm integration**: Browse releases, view managed resources, uninstall
- **HPA scaling**: Press `S` on a HorizontalPodAutoscaler to edit its min/max replica bounds and scale its target workload (Deployment / StatefulSet / ReplicaSet) in one overlay
- **KEDA integration**: Pause/unpause ScaledObjects and ScaledJobs
- **External Secrets integration**: Force refresh ExternalSecrets, ClusterExternalSecrets, and PushSecrets
- **CRD discovery**: Automatically discovers installed CRDs and groups them by API group

### Customization

- **460+ built-in color schemes** from [ghostty themes](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty): Tokyonight, Catppuccin, Dracula, Nord, Rose Pine, Gruvbox, and many more. Transparent background support.
- **Runtime theme switching**: Press `T` to preview and switch themes without restarting
- **Auto dark/light mode**: configure a dark and a light scheme; lfk switches automatically when the OS appearance changes (requires CSI 996/2031 terminal support: Ghostty, kitty, Contour, …)
- **Custom color themes** via config file (Tokyonight theme by default)
- **Configurable keybindings** for direct actions, including `Ctrl+Shift` chords that stay distinct from plain `Ctrl` (requires Kitty keyboard protocol or xterm `modifyOtherKeys`: Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm, foot, xterm — not macOS Terminal.app; see [Ctrl+Shift chords](docs/keybindings.md#ctrlshift-chords))
- **Configurable search abbreviations**
- **Configurable filter presets** per resource type (extend built-in quick filters with `.`)
- **Configurable icon modes**: `auto` (default, detects Nerd Font-capable terminals like Ghostty/Kitty/WezTerm), `unicode`, `nerdfont` (Material Design Icons), `simple` (ASCII labels), `emoji`, or `none`. Override at runtime with the `LFK_ICONS` environment variable. Also decides how the which-key panel and help screen draw keys: Nerd Font keycaps (`󰘴 D`), Unicode symbols (`⌃D`), or names (`ctrl+d`).
- **Configurable table columns** (global, per-resource-type, and per-cluster)
- **Column visibility toggle** overlay to show/hide and reorder columns at runtime (`,` key)
- **Startup tips**: Random tips on startup to help discover features (configurable via `tips: false`)
- **Status-aware coloring**: Running=green, Pending=yellow, Failed=red — also applied to CRD printer-column values: recognized status words (Active, Failed, Pending, ...) get their severity color, and True/False values follow the column's polarity (Established=False red, Failed=False green)
- **Row status tint**: failed/progressing rows stay visible even when the Status column is hidden — `foreground` (default) colors the row's Name cell in the status color when Status is hidden, `background` adds a muted status-colored row background, `off` disables it. Set via `appearance.row_status_tint`
- **Resource usage metrics**: CPU/MEM with color-coded bars in dashboard
- **Node uptime column**: time since each node last booted, to spot restarts. Requires Prometheus as the monitoring source and node_exporter (the Kubernetes API does not expose boot time)

## Navigation Hierarchy

```
Clusters (kubeconfig contexts)
  +-- Resource Types (grouped: Workloads, Networking, Config, Storage, ArgoCD, Helm, ...)
        +-- Resources (e.g., individual Deployments)
              +-- Owned Resources (Pods via ownerReferences, Jobs for CronJobs, etc.)
                    +-- Containers (for Pods)
```

Namespaces are **not** a navigation level. The current namespace is shown in the top-right corner and can be changed by pressing `\`. All-namespaces mode is enabled by default (toggle with `A`). Inside the namespace selector, press `Space` to include namespaces, `Tab` to exclude them (negative selection — shows all except the marked namespaces, each prefixed with `!`), `A` to reset to all-namespaces mode, or `R` to refresh the list from the cluster. Press `.` to quick-filter straight to the namespace of the resource highlighted behind the overlay.

### Owner Resolution

- **Deployments** show their Pods (resolved through ReplicaSets, flattened)
- **StatefulSets / DaemonSets / Jobs** show their Pods directly
- **CronJobs** show their Jobs
- **Services** show Pods matching the service selector
- **ArgoCD Applications** show managed resources (from status or label discovery)
- **Helm Releases** show managed resources (via `app.kubernetes.io/instance` label)
- **Pods** show their Containers
- **ConfigMaps / Secrets / Ingresses / PVCs** show details preview (no children)

## Keybindings

> For the complete keybinding reference (YAML view, log viewer, describe, diff, exec mode, and all sub-modes), see [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md). Press `F1` in-app for the built-in help screen, `?` for the which-key action panel.

| `?` | Which-key action panel: hotkeys actionable right now, descriptions colored by category with a color legend at the bottom (scroll: `Ctrl+D`/`Ctrl+U`, close: `esc`; `?` again switches between category and key order, kept for the session). Also in every fullscreen viewer except exec mode, where it lists what that viewer supports in its current state. `F1` opens full help |
| `m<slot>` / `'<slot>` | Set / jump to bookmark (lowercase = context-aware, uppercase = context-free) |
| `t` / `]` / `[` | New tab / next / previous |
| `}` / `{` | Move current tab right / left |

All views (YAML, logs, describe, diff, exec) use vim-style navigation (`j`/`k`, `gg`/`G`, `Ctrl+D`/`Ctrl+U`, `/` search, `v`/`V` visual selection). See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md) for the full reference.

> For the complete command bar reference (built-in commands, shell/kubectl execution, resource jumps), see [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md).

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/lfk/config.yaml` to customize the application. All fields are optional; only the values you specify will override the defaults.

> For the complete configuration reference, see [docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md) and [docs/config-example.yaml](docs/config-example.yaml).

### Quick Start

```yaml
# Color scheme (press T in-app to browse 460+ themes with live preview)
# Auto dark/light mode — Ghostty-style "dark:X,light:Y" syntax switches the
# scheme when the OS appearance changes (CSI 996/2031; Ghostty, kitty >= 0.27, …)
colorscheme: "dark:catppuccin-mocha,light:catppuccin-latte"

# Use terminal's own background
transparent_background: true

# Icon mode: "auto" (default, detects Nerd Font terminals like Ghostty/Kitty/WezTerm),
# "unicode", "nerdfont" (requires Nerd Font in terminal), "simple" (ASCII labels),
# "emoji", or "none". The LFK_ICONS env var overrides this setting.
icons: auto

# Disable mouse capture (allows native terminal text selection)
mouse: false

# Custom keybinding overrides (only specify what you want to change)
keybindings:
  logs: "ctrl+l"
  toggle_preview_logs: "L"
  describe: "v"
  delete: "D"

# Search abbreviations (extend built-in abbreviations for :pod, :dep, etc.)
abbreviations:
  myapp: myapplications
```

### Search Modes

All search and filter inputs support three modes, auto-detected from the query string:

| Mode | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Substring | plain text | `nginx` |
| Regex | auto-detected | `err[0-9]+` |
| Fuzzy | `~` prefix | `~deplymnt` |
| Literal | `\` prefix | `\err.*` |

**Clipboard paste**: All search, filter, and command bar inputs accept pasted text (`Cmd+V` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+V` on Linux). Multiline paste shows a confirmation dialog.

**Recall previous queries**: While the `f` filter or `/` search input is open, press `Up` / `Down` to cycle through previous queries. `/` and `f` share one history (the matcher and matched fields are identical between them), kept separate from the `:` command bar. The log viewer's `/` search has its own history because it matches raw log lines (substring/regex over arbitrary text) rather than resource names — pooling it would surface irrelevant entries. All three persist across sessions under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/lfk/` (default `~/.local/state/lfk/`) — `query-history` for explorer `/` and `f`, `log-search-history` for the log viewer's `/`, and `history` for the command bar.

## Tips and Tricks

- Peek at Pod/Deployment logs with `L` (live-log preview pane), or open the fullscreen log viewer with `Ctrl+L`
- Jump straight to a resource type from anywhere: type `:pod`, `:dep`, `:pvc` in the command bar
- Press `o` on a resource to jump to its owner (e.g. Pod -> Deployment), then `Backspace` to jump back
- Typos are fine in search: `/~deplymnt` fuzzy-matches `deployments`
- Multi-select with `Space` (range-select with `Ctrl+Space`), then bulk delete/scale/restart via `x`
- Set a bookmark with `m<letter>`, jump back with `'<letter>` - lowercase slots are context-aware. Each bookmark shows its saved namespace in the overlay and the jump applies it by default; press Tab to opt out and keep the current scope. An active list filter is saved with the bookmark and reapplied on jump (shown as `> /<filter>` in the slot name)
- Press `.` for quick filter presets (e.g. only failing Pods); extend them per resource type in config
- Decode Secret values in the preview with `Ctrl+S`, or edit them decoded with `e`
- Copy the resource name with `y`; press `Y` to copy as YAML, JSON, or Table
- Apply a manifest straight from your clipboard with `Ctrl+P`
- Hunt down unused ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs and more with `Shift+Z` (orphan detection)
- Run kubectl without leaving lfk (`:k get pods -o wide`) or any shell command (`:! curl ...`)
- Investigate a crash-looping Pod with `x` -> `I`: restart history, events, previous logs, and describe in one tabbed view
- Lock a session against destructive actions with `Ctrl+R` (read-only mode)
- Try a new look without restarting: `T` live-previews 460+ themes
- Resource stuck in Terminating? `Ctrl+G` searches its finalizers and removes them
- Press `Tab` inside `/` or `f` to broaden matching to labels, annotations, finalizers, and other column values
- Recall earlier queries with `Up`/`Down` inside `/`, `f`, and the `:` command bar - history persists across restarts
- See how a resource connects to everything else with `M` (relationship map)
- Need everything except a few namespaces? In the `\` selector, `Tab` excludes namespaces instead of selecting them
- Pin your daily-driver resource types with `p` and hide noisy ones via `x` - both remembered per cluster
- Teleport between levels with `0` / `1` / `2` (clusters / resource types / resources)
- Sort by any column with `>` / `<`, flip direction with `=`, reset with `-`
- Check firing Prometheus/Alertmanager alerts with `@` and namespace quotas with `Q`
- Open an Ingress host - or an active port-forward's localhost URL - in your browser with `Ctrl+O`; on a Service, `Ctrl+O` starts a port forward and opens it
- Save the selected resource manifest to a file with `W`
- Spin up a throwaway kind/k3d/minikube cluster without leaving lfk: `Ctrl+N` at the cluster list
- Capture a Pod's network traffic with `c` - live decode plus pcap export (kubectl-debug or kubeshark)
- Walk any resource's live object with `O` (Object Explorer): `r` finds keys recursively, `T` expands an ASCII tree, `y` copies the field path
- Forget `kubectl explain` - `I` opens the API Explorer, and `n`/`N` searches auto-drill into nested fields
- In the YAML viewer, press `O` on a line to jump into the Object Explorer at that attribute, or `I` to see its schema
- `Ctrl+K` opens a side pane with the schema description of the field under the cursor, and keeps it in step as you move
- Fold YAML sections with `z` (`Z` folds all); edit the resource in your `$EDITOR` with `Ctrl+E`
- Every viewer speaks vim: counts (`100j`, `42G`, `5n`), visual selections (`v` / `V` / `Ctrl+V`), and text objects (`viw`) work everywhere
- Make noisy logs readable with `P` - the structured preview parses JSON, logfmt, klog, zap, nginx, envoy, Java, and postgres lines
- Save logs to a file with `S` (loaded lines) or `Ctrl+S` (full history) - the path lands on your clipboard
- Switch pods or filter containers without leaving the log viewer: press `\`
- Replay a resource's event history as a timeline with `V`
- Flip the RBAC question: inside the Can-I browser (`U`), `Tab` opens Who-Can - every subject allowed to run a verb on a resource
- Get per-container CPU/memory recommendations with `x` -> `z` (Right-sizing Advisor, VPA-backed when available)
- Watch an ArgoCD Application roll out wave by wave: `x` -> `W` opens the Sync Wave Timeline
- Waiting for a rollout? `:nyan` and `:kubetris` are real commands
